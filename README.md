Automate the Boring Stuff With Python Practice and Project Repository

They may or may not be correct, complete, or the simplest "Pythonic" way, but these are the projects I practiced and solutions I found for some of the practice questions in the book **"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"** by [Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

**UPDATE 9/16:** 
Finally completed both the book and online [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/automate/). This was a great way to learn the foundations of the Python programming language. It also introduced me to using git for version control of just about everything.

**UPDATE 2/17:**
Had a few remaining practice problems that I could not solve originally, but after several additional months of diving into using Python I was able to return to these practice problems and get them resolved. This repository is now finalized!
